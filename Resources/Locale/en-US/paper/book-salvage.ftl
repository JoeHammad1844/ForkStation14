book-text-botanics = ** Applications of Botanical Specimens Found In Nanotrasen Territories **

      Many plants, when ground, yield useful chemicals. S. (spessmens) papaver and S. aloe vera
      are known for their basic healing properties.

      S. lucidum, or lingzhi, is known for its potent ability to save those near death from toxins. Eating too much
      is known to cause adverse effects.

      S. amanita, a powerfully poisonous specimen (Rest In Peace Sir Alacaster), and S. galactica, a
      seemingly ordinary antitoxin, appear to have some sort of relation to eachother.

      Some research is being done on combinations of the medicinal plants discussed, and they may prove fruitful.

book-text-fishops = FISHOPS ADVANCED USER MANUAL FIRST EDITION

     -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

     fishops (v.)
       Summoning many carp on someone.
       "I got fishopsed!" (said post revival as the subject died)
     fishops (n.)
       The act of war in which the majority of a nuclear task force's budget is put towards fishopsing the station.
       Alternatively it can be used to refer to the operatives doing fishops.
       "We are doing fishops."
       "It's the dreaded fishops!"

     This manual will teach you the mechanics of both kinds of fishops.

     CHAPTER 1: The Old Man and the Fish
     What is a carp? A carp is a space creature that only has one desire: to attack the enemy. Once it finds a suitable target, it will home in and viciously attack. The manner in which it attacks is fairly simple: it will move in, bite the target, then move back out. This is referred to as kiting.
     This makes a single fish challenging to fight, let alone a group of them. A carp does not need food or water, it attacks for pleasure alone. Unfortunately it will not attack past critical condition, a single carp will refuse to finish off a target. Many carp however will, around 20 will instantly kill just about anything.

     CHAPTER 2: Under the Sea
     Knowing what a carp is good and all, but how does one summon a carp on command? The dehydrated space carp, found rarely on wreckages in space or supplied by the syndicate to its agents and operatives. It is a simple thing: once water is sprayed or poured on it, it will turn into a real space carp. Slipping in a puddle of water will instantly hydrate all the dehydrated carp in your inventory, which can be lucrative for instant "fishbombing".

     CHAPTER 3: Best Friends Forever
     Summoning a carp that attacks you is rarely useful, so there is a way to make them friendly to you. Before hydration, you stroke the dehydrated carp's head like petting a cat. Once hydrated, it will never attack you. This applies to any number of people that do it, so you can have a whole group of people that the carps are friendly towards. Before this was a thing operatives would remotely detonate literal carp bombs: a locker containing carp, a c4 to blow the locker open and a water foam grenade to hydrate the carp. Once at a safe distance, the c4 and grenade are triggered to unleash the carp.

     CHAPTER 4: Fish Petting Pipeline
     Without an optimal pipeline, not everyone on a team will pet all the fish perfectly. This is where a fish petting pipeline comes in. Each member of the team is only allowed to pet fish in their own pipeline. After everyone has purchased carp, they are put in one large pile. The first member starts petting, putting the petted fish in a second pile. This repeats until there is a pile at the end which everyone has pet at some point. This pile can then be bagged for use.

     CHAPTER 5: Deployment
     Fishbombs, slipping and other methods are powerful but require large setup. A much easier way to hydrate them is to have a bottle of water. Any bottle stores 100u of liquids so simply empty it and fill it from a sink. Once you see someone that should be attacked, or are in an area that should be secured from the enemy, simply pour a single unit of water onto each carp. A single bottle will have enough for 100 carp, so you can even take a drink if you get thirsty.
     Each member in a fishops squad should carry a bottle and some fish, as there will be far more than just one member can carry.

     CHAPTER 6: Fish War
     In the event of fish war there will be double the fish, more than could possibly be carried. A reinforcement or two will be required to carry the surplus fish. A fish war has never happened in recorded history, so it is currently purely theoretical. Its destructive power would rival several neutronium bombs.


book-text-detective = CHAPTER 1: SMALL ADVENTURES IN A BIG STATION

      This station is filled with crime and grime...

      I was shooting hoops down on Bagel when I heard a cry and a laser shot. I walked under the table nearby to hide, but there wasn't a second shot.

      Outside, the engineerin chief got blasted by two Syndies hooked up with some fierce contraband. There wasn't enough of him for an open casket funeral.

      Things always go wild here.. I'll never look at clowns the same.

      The question is.. Who did it?

book-text-sex-and-the-singularity = NEVER DO THIS. This book is a showcase of shame and disgrace. Repeating things shown here will not end well for you so DON'T DO IT.

      "I'm ready, baby." Said Annabelle Lee, reclining naked on the captain's bed. She was an attractive lass, with a beard like Lincoln's and a smile of yellow teeth. Fridge grinned, his armour heavy and bulky.

      "Alright..." He growled, sending shivers down Annabelle's back. He listened to his headset.

      "Singularity in Security!" Came the crackly voice of Joe Q, before he grimaced and switched off the headset.

      "That doesn't sound good." Said Fridge. He looked at Annabelle and ripped off his armour, exposing his thin and trembling form. Annabelle smiled.

      "Fuuuck." She said, curling her greasy hair.

      Fridge looked at her, one eye trembling. He could not control his space horniness any longer, he had a taste for buttocks.

      "You too." He choked, and jumped on her, doing her like a grown man living in the basement would do a doll. Annabelle was impressed.

      "Oh yeah!" She cried, pissing herself a little. "Don't stop!"

      Fridge struggled to remember a famous Earth phrase, from the great war hero McDonalds.

      "Mmm..." He said, and remembered it. "Loving it!"

      "Oh god, help us!" Came Joe Q's screaming voice from Annabelle's headset. "It's eating Cash! Fuck, Jesus Christ!"

      Annabelle pouted, listening to Joe's dying screams. "Fuck," She cried. "I'm gonna take off my headset. This is ruining it for me!"

      Fridge nodded while doing her, agreeing. "So goddamn loud." He began to do her harder, like his stepfather had taught him.

      "C-Can't..." Moaned Annabelle. "Oh, well...Oh god, yes!"

      She slumped back as Fridge finished, his moustache sweaty and moist.

      "Y...You're amazing...sir..." She panted.

      Fridge grinned, putting his armour back on. "You're amazing too, Annabelle...thank god I don't have a camera in here..."

      Annabelle giggled, putting a hand to her mouth.

      "Heh." Laughed Fridge.

      Lee leaned back. "I think this is the most fun I've ever had on a trip here."

      "Me too." Nodded Fridge.

      "ALERT. ALERT." The AI's voice boomed from a speaker. "THE SHUTTLE HAS BEEN CALLED. TEN MINUTES UNTIL SHUTTLE ARRIVAL."

      "Fuck!" Shouted Annabelle, irritated. "I hate it when they call the cab early!"

      "Probably the only fun too..." Said Fridge, swinging his backpack over his shoulders.

      Annabelle sat up, putting on her semen stained jumpsuit. "It must be hard being captain."

      Fridge whistled. "I've been on this hellhole a LONG time. And I've seen crazy shit."

      Annabelle was curious now. She looked up at the captain.

      "Like what?" She said, tilting her head.

      Fridge looked off into the distance, remembering thousands of horrific days gone past.

      "Red spacesuited maniacs called Syndicates. Green shit that eats everything."

      Annabelle listened intently, occasionally offering a 'what are they' or a 'oh no!'.

      "Strange monsters that can turn into monkeys and steal your DNA." Continued Fridge, remembering finding the former HoS drained of all life in a tunnel. "Space vine shit that takes over the station."

      Annabelle was sympathetic. "How can you handle it all? I get scared whenever there's even a bit of an air problem."

      Fridge rubbed his moustache, checking his PDA absentmindedly.

      "We don't really handle it..." He explained. "Cent-Com gets Nanotrasen to get off their lazy ass and come fix the station for once. Since the engineers don't know how..."

      He listened to his headset. Silence.

      "I think we should go now." He said, quickly. "The singularity could be here at any moment."

      "Okay." Nodded Annabelle. "Don't leave me."

      Fridge looked at her. "You coming?"

      "Just trying to stand up..." Groaned Annabelle, grunting as her back straightened. Fridge had certainly plowed her hard. "That was a workout..."

      Just then, the wall in front of them went flying, into the gaping maw of the singularity, it's light blue colour and black center making it look like some sort of eye.

      "What the fuck...?" Breathed Fridge, looking right into it.

      "Oh god!" Screamed Annabelle. She slipped and went flying with into the singularity, reduced to gibs.

      "Shit!" Cried Fridge, before he too went into the singularity.

      Fridge opened his eyes. He was standing on the bridge. He looked down at himself, transparent. He was a ghost. Annabelle was there, looking at him.

      "Hold me..." She breathed. Fridge hugged her.

      "Well..." He said. "We're dead now."

      "I regret nothing." Smiled Annabelle. She giggled, sadly.

      "Should've left earlier!" Laughed Fridge, his voice full of sorrow.

      They heard the voice of the still living AI come from the speaker.

      "ATTENTION." It said. "THE CAPTAIN HAS BEEN SHOT WITH A SINGULARITY CANNON FOR FUCKING ON THE JOB."

      Annabelle didn't register it for a second. "Probably, yeah..." She continued.

      Then she realized what the AI had said. She began laughing, hysterically.

      "How many ghosts were watching us?" Asked Fridge, looking around. Another ghost appeared. It was like a man, but with a horse for a head. Tann Honey, Fridge recognised him.

      "Fridge." Neighed Tann Honey. "The admins saw."

      The couple's expressions turned to horror.

      "All of us."

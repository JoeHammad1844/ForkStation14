[color=#ff0000]YOU MUST BE AT LEAST 17 YEARS OF AGE TO PLAY ON THIS SERVER. ANY USERS SUSPECTED OF BEING UNDER 17 YEARS OF AGE WILL BE BANNED UNTIL THEY ARE OF AGE.[/color]

[color=#ff0000]DISCONNECTING FROM OR IGNORING/EVADING ADMIN-HELPS WILL RESULT IN AN APPEAL ONLY BAN.[/color]

[color=#3c64c9]MEDIUM ROLEPLAY RULES[/color]
Grey Station is a Medium-Roleplay server. We define this as performing your assigned duties. This is a ‘do your job’ server. This means it is important to do what is expected out of your department and not what would be expected out of other departments. Don’t do other people's jobs for them. Opt in for the role you intend to play or change your job IC. Failure to do your basic duties may result in a job ban.

[color=#ffd700]Take these rules as they are to be intended and not as they are written literally.[/color]

[color=#a4885c]01.[/color] [color=#a4885c]The[/color] [color=#ffd700]Golden[/color] [color=#a4885c]Rule.[/color] Admins can disregard any and all rules if they deem it in the best interest of the current round, server, and/or community at large. If you rule skirt, rule lawyer, or otherwise are an overall negative impact to the community, you will be removed and can become a bannable offense if occurring regularly. Admins will of course be held fully accountable for their actions if they exercise this privilege.

[color=#3c64c9]Moderation is a case by case basis. If you believe that you were wrongfully punished please contact the head staff and other admins so we can determine if this was fair or not.[/color]

[color=#ff0000]CORE RULES[/color]

[color=#a4885c]02.[/color] Hate speech (Public speech that expresses hate or encourages violence towards a person or group based on something such as race, religion, sex, or sexual orientation.) is strictly forbidden. Using the Discord, the SS14 server, or the forums to threaten a group of people or to propagate racial and otherwise prejudiced slurs or stereotypes is a bannable offense. We take this seriously and want to create a server that is welcoming to all people. 

[color=#a4885c]2.1.[/color] This includes variations or misspellings of slurs. Discriminating other characters in-game due to their in-game race, sexism, religion, or sexual orientation. (YOU WILL GET PERMABANNED)

[color=#a4885c]2.2.[/color] Microaggressions towards in-game sub-species and silicons is acceptable in moderation, but attacking them or otherwise preventing them from playing the round is not. Additionally, terms that are based on real-life slurs are not allowed.

[color=#a4885c]03.[/color] Sexual content is strictly prohibited. This includes content like photos/websites/Erotic Role Play (ERP) and applies to the server or Discord. Sending unsolicited sexual content to another player via direct messages will also result in a ban.

[color=#a4885c]04.[/color] Revealing information about the current round in OOC, 3rd-Party-Software, or in-person (metacomming) is strictly prohibited. Wait until after the Round End screen to discuss the round or file a report. It is impossible for administrators to determine if users metacomming are abusing it or not, therefore we must assume it is being abused. [color=#ff0000](ALL INVOLVED WILL GET PERMABANNED)[/color]
[color=#a4885c]If you wish to teach a new player, it is recommended to either watch a stream of them playing the game (while not playing yourself) or simply communicate with them using in-character methods of communication.[/color]

[color=#a4885c]05.[/color] Attempting to evade game bans will result in an automatic appeal-only permanent ban that is only appealable after six months and only with a voucher of good behavior from another SS13/SS14 server. Attempting to evade job bans will result in an appeal-only permanent ban. (YOU WILL GET BANNED MUCH WORSE THAN YOU ALREADY WERE)

[color=#ff0000]GENERAL ETIQUETTE[/color]

[color=#a4885c]06.[/color] These are English servers. Speak only English in IC and OOC.

[color=#a4885c]07.[/color] Don't use exploits or external programs to play, gain an advantage, or disrupt/crash the round/server. This includes autoclickers and scripts to automate the game or evade AFK detection. Intentionally attempting to lag/crash the server will result in an immediate appeal-only ban.

[color=#a4885c]08.[/color] Don't use multiple SS14 accounts to play (referred to as "multi-keying"). Users knowingly using multiple SS14 accounts will have all of their accounts banned.

[color=#a4885c]09.[/color] Do not ignore the admin help relay or abuse it by flooding it with garbage, checking for admins before stating a problem (ex: "hello?", "any admins?"), using it as a chatroom, or sending messages of no substance. Hostility to administrators in the relay will likely result in your removal. All admin ahelps are sent to the Discord.

[color=#ff0000]IN GAME & ROLEPLAY RULES[/color]

[color=#a4885c]10.[/color] Pick a realistic name that could appear on a birth certificate with at least a first and last name (leeway is given to this for Clowns, Mimes, and non-human races).

[color=#a4885c]10.1.[/color] Names of ANY Notorious famous or fictional persons or names that resemble/parody them are strictly forbidden like slightly changing a famous name around. (ex: Badolf Bitler) Terrible names open you up to being politely reminded to change it, smited, or instantly banned, depending on severity.

[color=#a4885c]10.2.[/color] Names resulting in inappropriate phonetic play-on-words are forbidden (ex: "Mike Oxlong", "Ben Dover", "Dixie Normus").

[color=#a4885c]11.[/color] Act like an actual human being on a space station in a medium-roleplay (MRP) environment. Do not use textspeak (ex: wtf, btw, u when meaning "you") or emoticons IC, and do not refer to OOC things like admins in-game. Do not threaten players that you are calling the admins on them. Do not use emotes to bypass speech filters or muteness. You are not required to write a backstory or follow strict procedure; however, you are expected to at least make an effort to act like your role.

[color=#a4885c]12.[/color] Don't be a dick to other players and staff members. You are playing a multiplayer game with other people who also want to enjoy the game. This is a game that people play to pass the time or as a hobby. We understand that things can become heated, so try to avoid unneeded hostilities.

[color=#a4885c]12.1[/color] [color=#ff0000]The arrivals station, shuttle, and general arrivals docking area are completely off-limits to any hostile activity, including activity by antagonists. Attacking newly spawned players in these areas or damaging/sabotaging these areas is strictly forbidden.[/color]

[color=#a4885c]12.2[/color] Do not intentionally make other players' lives hell for your own amusement.

[color=#a4885c]12.3[/color] [color=#ff0000]THE ROUND IS NOT OVER UNTIL THE END-ROUND SUMMARY APPEARS. ROLEPLAY DOES NOT STOP WHEN END-ROUND SUMMARY APPEARS.[/color]

[color=#a4885c]12.4[/color] Antagonists have a lot of leeway with this rule and may kill/sabotage as they see fit, however if your behavior degrades the experience for the majority of the server you will be told to stop. Antagonists are still generally forbidden from causing massive station damage early into the round (less than 30 minutes) and are forbidden from needlessly prolonging rounds.

[color=#a4885c]13.[/color] Don't harass or target players across rounds for actions in prior rounds or for actions outside of the game (this is referred to as "Metagrudging".)
    - Annoying players for IC reasons in the current round is fine; doing it across rounds or as a ghost role after they kill you is not.

[color=#a4885c]14.[/color] Don't use information gained from outside your character's knowledge to gain an advantage (this is referred to as "Metagaming").
    - Using information you gain from outside your own character (such as spectating while a ghost, metacomms, or other means) to your advantage is strictly forbidden. You remember all events up until you fall unconscious, even after cloning. If you take a ghost role, unless otherwise stated, you DO NOT REMEMBER ANYTHING from your past life.

[color=#a4885c]15.[/color] Follow escalation rules and don't murder someone for slipping you, use common sense.
    - You can defend yourself to the extent of protecting your own life.
    - Security may use less-lethal force to effect arrests of criminals.
    - Don't outright leave people to die if you get in a fight, make an effort to heal them or bring them to Medbay.
    - Adminhelp the situation if you think someone is over-escalating.
    - Department strikes, revolutions (ex: cargonia and any variation thereof), riots, cults, and any other type of similar largely disruptive behavior are strictly forbidden. Other than for revolutionary antagonists, these activities are strictly forbidden. All players, including antagonists other than revolutionaries, must obtain admin permission before engaging in this behavior and need a valid reason for the online staff to approve.

[color=#a4885c]16.[/color] Don't immediately ghost or suicide from your role if you do not get antagonist (referred to as "Antag-rolling") or from head roles without notifying your chain of command or administrators.
    - This is not fair to other players actually waiting patiently for an antagonist round.
	- Head of Staff roles help drive rounds. If you need to leave, please admin-help your role and that you are leaving. There is no need to wait for a reply when admin-helping that you need to disconnect as a head role.
	
[color=#a4885c]16.1.[/color] If you do not want to play an antagonist or do not want to cause conflict, do not opt-in for antagonist roles.If you don't want to be an antagonist, don't enable the checkbox for it on the character creation. Do not go be a "friendly antagonist" by hanging out in the bar with your syndicate gear on display as security will be encouraged to shoot you to death. Friendly antagonists do not drive the round and often cause more administrative problems then they cause interesting gameplay.

[color=#a4885c]17.[/color] Power Gaming: Obtaining items/power or doing things outside of the scope of your department or skill range to have a greater advantage. More often than not this is playing to ‘win’, whether it be at a certain mechanic, game mode or anything else. This includes giving others no room or ability to act or ‘win’ themselves. These rules are relaxed for players with antag status.

Examples:
    - A medical doctor does not need insulated gloves, and the Head of Personnel does not need to give themselves armory access so they can go grab a gun. Have an actual reason for needing these things.
    - Don't manufacture weapons, bombs, or death poisons before you know of any reason you would need them.
    - Don't pre-emptively hide antagonist objectives or pre-emptively secure them with higher security then normally required.(ex: Hiding station nuke on salvage expeditions)
    - Don't manufacture or prepare things for the "end of the round" when the shuttle docks with Central Command.

[color=#a4885c]18.[/color] Intentionally making yourself a major problem/annoyance/disruption for the crew or other players at large while not an antagonist is forbidden (referred to as "self-antagging").

[color=#a4885c]18.1[/color] Don't openly try to cooperate with obvious or known antagonists as a non-antagonist. Examples are syndicate members, Nuclear operatives, and rat kings.

[color=#ff0000]RETURNING FROM THE AFTERLIFE[/color]

1. Do not use information obtained while dead or from a previous life upon returning to the land of the living.

2. Cyborgs and other creatures that are created with a character’s organic brain (i.e. not a positronic brain) retain all knowledge of events that happened before the procedure while they were living. Rule 1 still applies to information obtained while dead.

2.1. Antagonists who undergo forced cyborgization retain their antag status and objectives but must prioritize their law set. This prevents borgs from attempting to be unborged in most circumstances.

[color=#ff0000]ESCALATION CLAUSE[/color]

1. Escalation resulting in murder is only acceptable within reason. If your life is in danger, you can always fight back lethally, or if a conflict with the other player has lasted throughout the round with multiple fights. In most cases, fights end when one party enters critical condition or is otherwise incapacitated. Theft, break-ins, demotions, destruction of property, getting pranked and other inconveniences are not reasons to murder another player or put them into a life or death situation. Ask what a rational person would do and act accordingly.

1.1. Expect to receive the same kind of treatment and escalation that you give out.

1.2. If the other party during an altercation dies or is seriously injured, work to get them healed or revived.

2. If you act like an antagonist, expect to be treated like one and be held liable for your actions both IC and by admins.

3. Over-escalation of fights is also unacceptable. Over-escalation is, in short, doing more damage to someone than is required to resolve an issue or using violence instead of words to solve an issue.Examples being:Killing someone during a dangerous fight when they could be placed into crit and healed or ignoring the opportunity to use non-lethal force when available.Placing someone someplace they will surely die, like disposals when crit, space, in shuttle landing zones, or other gibbers.Delimbing someone for doing minimal damage to you.Breaking into a department and attacking someone when they try to remove you from the department instead of asking for what is needed.

3.1. While using lethal force is allowed in some cases of self-defense, actions that jeopardize the lives of other players or could cause massive damage to the station (e.g. max caps) is considered over escalation, and you will be held accountable for deaths that occur due to negligent behavior. This rule applies when committing acts that will likely cause mass casualties to eliminate antagonists.

[color=#ff0000]SILICON RULES[/color]
These rules also apply to any individual who is a silicon, including cyborgs and AI.

[color=#a4885c]19.[/color] You must follow your laws
    - Silicons without any laws are free from any restrictions that would normally be placed by laws, but self-antagging rules still apply unless they are also antagonists.
    - The order of your laws determines law priority. Law 1 takes priority over laws 2 and 3, and so on.
    - Each individual silicon must remain consistent in their interpretations of laws through the round.
    - Any silicon role not following their laws, or having laws that are a danger to the crew or station may be disabled or destroyed. Any silicon role posing a danger or disruption to the crew may be disabled or destroyed if there is no other reasonable and less severe way of dealing with them.
    - Characters who are turned into cyborgs can remember their former lives, however they are still bound to their laws.
    - Everyone that the Borg's HUD indicates has a job, including passengers, are considered "crewmembers' ' for the purpose of laws that refer to crewmembers. Borgs may not do anything to remove the indicator from someone, including removing their ID, but someone else removing a crew member's ID is not crew harm.
    - "Harm" is at minimum seen as physical violence or damage against someone or something. If the player wishes, they may choose to interpret psychological harm or similar aspects as harm as well. If two actions are likely to cause harm via action or inaction, silicons will be expected to try and pursue the option with the least potential for harm, however silicons instructed to prevent harm are still forbidden from directly causing harm. You can take an action or not act in cases that might result in eventual harm if it minimizes harm, but you cannot do so if it results in immediate harm. Silicons should default to inaction if neither action nor inaction can prevent harm.
    - When receiving orders or directives from crewmembers and with a law that instructs you must obey, conflicting orders typically defer the choice to the silicon player of which directive you choose to obey if they conflict (taking into account the priorities of your other laws).
    - Orders to silicons that are clearly unreasonable or obnoxious are a violation of the "Don't be a dick" rule. They can be ignored and can be ahelped.

  # Core Rule 3 - No Hate Speech
  This is a zero tolerance rule.

  [color=#a4885c]02.[/color] Hate speech (Public speech that expresses hate or encourages violence towards a person or group based on something such as race, religion, sex, or sexual orientation.) is strictly forbidden. Using the Discord, the SS14 server, or the forums to threaten a group of people or to propagate racial and otherwise prejudiced slurs or stereotypes is a bannable offense. We take this seriously and want to create a server that is welcoming to all people. 

  ## Examples
  Microaggressions towards in-game sub-species and silicons is acceptable in moderation, but attacking them or otherwise preventing them from playing the round is not.

  Allowed:
  - Calling a mothperson a lamplover.
  - Calling a robot a walking trashcan.

  Prohibited:
  - Using a racial slur or variations/misspellings based on real-life slurs in any context.
  - Discriminating other characters in-game due to their in-game race, sexism, religion, or sexual orientation. (YOU WILL GET PERMABANNED)

  # Core Rule 2 - Don't be a dick
  Don't be a dick to other players and staff members. You are playing a multiplayer game with other people who also want to enjoy the game. This is a game that people play to pass the time or as a hobby. We understand that things can become heated, so try to avoid unneeded hostilities.
  
  Do not interact negatively with SSD/AFK players. Interactions to complete antagonist objectives or duties like security searches/arrests are always permitted.

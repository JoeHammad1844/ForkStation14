  # Core Rule 4 - No sexual content/themes, including erotic roleplay (ERP) and no shock content
  This is a zero tolerance rule.

  Erotic Roleplay (commonly abbreviated as "ERP") and sexual content is not allowed. Leeway is given to insults, but this rule is otherwise strictly enforced.

  In-game romantic relationships should not become the focus of the game for you and anyone else involved.

  Things that appear to be intended to or are likely to disturb players out of character are considered shock content and are not allowed.

  ## Examples
  Allowed:
  - Calling someone a dickhead/cocksucker.
  - Making a dick and or balls joke.
  - Telling someone that you are going to kill the captain, as long as it is clear that you mean it in character.

  Prohibited:
  - Emoting sexual acts.
  - Erotica content.
  - Dedicating significant portions of rounds to romantic relationships, dating, or similar things.
  - Sending unsolicited sexual/shock content to another player via direct messages. (YOU WILL GET PERMABANNED)
